# Task 2: Data Cleaning & EDA on Titanic Dataset

## Objective
The goal of this task was to clean the Titanic dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between various variables and uncover patterns in the data.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: Titanic Dataset
- **Link**: [Titanic Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## Approach
1. **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
2. **EDA**: Explored relationships between survival rates, gender, and passenger class.
3. **Visualization**: Created bar charts and histograms to visualize data patterns.

## Key Insights
- Women and children had a higher survival rate than men.
- Passengers traveling in first class had better chances of survival.
- Age and class significantly influenced survival rates.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Files
- **Titanic_EDA.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with the code for cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Conclusion
This task allowed me to apply data cleaning techniques and explore important features in the Titanic dataset, giving me insights into factors affecting survival.
